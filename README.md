#Single Page Layout Demo

This is a single page layout design centered on a art exhibit in Atlanta, Ga.

I want this to demonstrate my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript as they pertain to page layout.

I also want to demonstrate my basic understanding of Github and use of git within projects.
